<h2>Maps</h2>
<p>There's a map on the wall of my apartment.  Not a good one.  It's one of those oversized, mass-produced things you buy at Target because the wall looked too empty and you panicked.  It has that faux-vintage look, like someone dipped it in coffee and called it interior design.  But I look at it a lot.</p>
<p>Here's the thing about maps: they lie.  Not in the way that people lie, with intent and self-preservation.  Maps lie structurally.  The Mercator projection—the one you've been looking at your entire life, the one in every classroom, every textbook, every office wall—it makes Greenland look the size of Africa.  Africa is fourteen times larger than Greenland.  Fourteen.  You could fit the United States, China, India, and most of Western Europe inside the African continent and still have room for Japan.  But on the map, Greenland sits up there looking like a serious contender.</p>
<p>We just accepted this.  For centuries.  Nobody rioted.  Nobody filed a class action.  We collectively looked at a wildly distorted image of the planet we live on and said, "Yeah, that tracks."</p>
<p>I think about this more than I should.</p>
<p>The projection was designed in 1569 by a Flemish cartographer named Gerardus Mercator.  He wasn't trying to mislead anyone.  He was trying to help sailors.  The whole point was to make navigation easier—straight lines on the map correspond to constant compass bearings.  If you're crossing the Atlantic in the sixteenth century and your primary concern is not dying at sea, accurate relative landmass size is pretty far down your priority list.  Fair enough.</p>
<p>But the map outlived its purpose.  It stopped being a navigational tool and became the image of the world.  The thing designed for a specific, narrow function got promoted to universal truth.  And now every kid grows up thinking Russia is incomprehensibly massive—which it is, but not as massive as the map suggests—and that South America is roughly the same width as North America, which is just laughably wrong.</p>
<p>This happens everywhere if you look for it.  Systems designed for one thing quietly become the thing itself.  </p>
<p>Credit scores were invented so banks could decide who to lend to.  That was the scope.  A number to help a loan officer make a faster decision.  Now your credit score determines whether you can rent an apartment, get a job, how much you pay for car insurance.  A tool built for lending decisions became a general measure of human reliability.  That's not what it was for.  That's never what it was for.</p>
<p>The BMI—Body Mass Index—was created by a Belgian mathematician in the 1830s.  Not a doctor.  A mathematician.  He was trying to define the "average man" for statistical purposes.  He explicitly said it should not be used to evaluate individual health.  It is now the primary metric your doctor uses to evaluate your individual health.</p>
<p>The SAT was originally designed as an Army IQ test during World War I.  It was adapted for college admissions because someone thought it would be a good proxy for academic potential.  A test designed to sort soldiers became the gatekeeper for higher education.  Generations of seventeen-year-olds had panic attacks over a repurposed military exam.</p>
<p>The map becomes the territory.  The tool becomes the truth.  The proxy becomes the thing it was proxying for.</p>
<p>I wonder how much of what I believe about myself is a Mercator projection.  Some simplified version of the truth that was useful once—maybe when I was fifteen and needed a personality to survive high school—that I never bothered to update.  I'm the funny one.  I'm the one who doesn't take things seriously.  I'm the one who's fine.</p>
<p>These might have been accurate navigational aids at some point.  Get through the day.  Don't be vulnerable.  Keep it light.  But at what point does the projection stop being a tool and start being the only version of the map you own?</p>
<p>Claire sees through this, I think.  Or at least she sees that there's a different projection available.  She doesn't buy the Greenland version of me—the one where everything's proportional, where I'm exactly the size I present myself as, where the borders are clean.</p>
<p>She's seen the actual landmass.  She knows Africa is fourteen times bigger than Greenland.</p>
<p>The scary part isn't that the map is wrong.  The scary part is that you can know the map is wrong and still navigate by it.  You can intellectually understand that Greenland is not that big and still, when someone asks you to picture the world, see Mercator.  The distortion is that deep.</p>
<p>I'm working on redrawing it.  But I've been looking at this map for twenty-five years, and some days I still think Greenland is huge.</p>

<h2>Diners</h2>
<p>I've never understood people who don't like diners.  What is wrong with you?  You don't like fluorescent lighting and sticky menus?  You don't want a woman named Pam to call you "hon" while she pours you coffee that tastes like it was brewed during the Carter administration?  You're too good for that?</p>
<p>Get over yourself.</p>
<p>There's a diner in Boulder City that I grew up going to.  I won't name it because I don't want any of you showing up.  It's mine.  But I'll describe it because I think about it a lot, especially when I'm sitting in Madison eating something that costs fourteen dollars and has microgreens on it.</p>
<p>The booths are red vinyl.  One of them has a tear that's been repaired with duct tape, and the duct tape has been there so long it's basically part of the booth now.  The counter has those round stools that spin—the kind that every kid in America has spun on until they almost threw up.  There's a pie case by the register.  The pies rotate, but there's always coconut cream.  Always.</p>
<p>The menu is laminated and enormous.  It has breakfast, lunch, dinner, and a section called "Specialties" that includes exactly nothing special.  A patty melt is not a specialty.  It is a hamburger that got lost on its way to the grill and ended up on rye bread.  I love it.  I will order it every time.</p>
<p>Here's what a diner gets right that almost every other dining experience gets wrong: it doesn't pretend to be anything.  There's no concept.  There's no vision.  Nobody sat in a design meeting and said, "What if the chairs were uncomfortable on purpose because discomfort promotes mindful eating?"  The chairs are uncomfortable because they bought them in 1987 and they work fine.</p>
<p>A diner says: here is food.  It is hot.  There is a lot of it.  Would you like more coffee?  Yes you would.  Here is more coffee.</p>
<p>That's it.  That's the entire value proposition.  And somehow it's better than ninety percent of restaurants I've been to.</p>
<p>I've been thinking about why.  And I think it's because diners are honest, and honesty is so rare in the dining industry that when you encounter it, it feels revolutionary.</p>
<p>When a restaurant charges you twenty-eight dollars for a piece of fish the size of a playing card, arranged on the plate like a crime scene photograph, surrounded by three dots of sauce that the chef applied with what I can only assume was a medical syringe—that restaurant is lying to you.  It is telling you that this experience is worth twenty-eight dollars.  It is not.  You are paying for the lighting.  You are paying for the Instagram story.  You are paying rent on a space that has exposed brick because exposed brick means we're allowed to charge more, apparently.</p>
<p>The diner charges you eight dollars for a piece of fish the size of your head, and it comes with fries and coleslaw and the coleslaw is bad but it's there.  Nobody is pretending the coleslaw is good.  It came with the plate because it has always come with the plate.  The fish is fried.  Of course it's fried.  What did you think was going to happen?  </p>
<p>I read something once—I think it was Anthony Bourdain, or maybe it was someone quoting Anthony Bourdain, or maybe it was someone who vaguely resembled Anthony Bourdain—about how the best food in the world is made by grandmothers who have been cooking the same six dishes for fifty years.  Not chefs.  Grandmothers.  People who never went to culinary school, never staged at a restaurant in Copenhagen, never dehydrated anything on purpose.  They just made the same thing over and over until it was perfect.</p>
<p>That's a diner.  The cook on the line has been making that patty melt since before you were born.  He doesn't need a recipe.  He doesn't need a sous chef.  He needs a flat-top and five minutes.  The patty melt is perfect not because anyone innovated.  It's perfect because repetition, over a long enough timeline, becomes mastery.</p>
<p>I want to take Claire to every diner in the American South.  I want her to experience a Waffle House at 2 a.m., which is the only correct time to go to a Waffle House.  I want her to watch a cook work a flat-top with the efficiency of a man who has made nine thousand eggs and will make nine thousand more.  I want her to eat grits for the first time and pretend she likes them even though she won't, because nobody likes grits the first time.  Grits are a relationship food.  You have to earn grits.</p>
<p>Actually, she'd probably love grits immediately.  She's Australian.  They eat Vegemite.  If you can eat Vegemite, you can eat anything.  Grits are a lateral move at worst.</p>
<p>There's something romantic about a diner, too, even though it has no business being romantic.  The lighting is bad.  The ambiance is the sound of plates being dropped in a kitchen and a TV in the corner playing local news.  But if you're sitting across from the right person, sharing a plate of disco fries at midnight, it doesn't matter.  The context falls away.  You're just two people and bad coffee and a booth with duct tape on it.</p>
<p>Hemingway wrote in cafés.  Hopper painted diners.  There's something about those spaces—public but intimate, communal but anonymous—that invites you to be yourself.  Or at least a version of yourself that isn't performing.  You don't dress up for a diner.  You don't check your phone to see how many people liked your story about being at the diner.  You just sit there.  You just eat.</p>
<p>I think that's what I'm chasing, if I'm being honest.  Spaces where the performance stops.  People and places that don't require me to be any particular version of myself.  Just: here is food.  It is hot.  There is a lot of it.  Would you like more coffee?</p>
<p>Yes.  I would always like more coffee.</p>

<h2>Names</h2>
<p>My name is Zachary David Rowe Murphy.  Four names.  Like I'm a serial killer or a president, which historically have had more overlap than we're comfortable admitting.</p>
<p>I've never been a "Zachary."  Nobody has ever called me Zachary and meant it kindly.  Zachary is the name on the ticket when you're in trouble.  Zachary is what the substitute teacher calls you on the first day before you correct her.  Zachary is the name your mother uses when she's about to list, in chronological order, every mistake you've made since birth.</p>
<p>I'm Zach.  One syllable.  Efficient.  It doesn't waste your time or mine.  You can yell it across a room, across a field, across a parking lot.  It punches through noise.  Try yelling "Zachary" at a football game.  You can't.  Too many syllables.  By the time you finish, the play is over.</p>
<p>David is my middle name and it does absolutely nothing.  It sits there between Zachary and Murphy like a kid on a bench who didn't get put in the game.  I forget it exists sometimes.  I'll be filling out a form and it'll ask for my middle name and I'll hesitate.  Not because I don't know it—because it's so unused that retrieving it requires the same mental effort as remembering a password I set in 2014.</p>
<p>Rowe is my mother's maiden name.  I carry it because she carried me, which seems like a fair trade.  One syllable in exchange for nine months of physical labor and a lifetime of emotional investment.  She got the worse deal.</p>
<p>Murphy.  Irish.  Predictable.  Go to any pub in Boston, throw a rock, you'll hit a Murphy.  You'll probably hit three.  We're everywhere.  We're the background noise of the Irish-American experience.  There are famous Murphys—Eddie, Audie, Brittany.  But we are not a dynasty family.  We are a "yeah, I think my neighbor growing up was a Murphy" family.  We are ubiquitous and unremarkable, which is exactly the right energy for a surname.</p>
<p>I think about what Claire's name will be, if she takes mine.  Claire Murphy.  It's clean.  It flows.  It sounds like a character in a novel—the kind of woman who solves things quietly while the loud men around her make a mess of it.  Which, come to think of it, is pretty accurate.</p>
<p>But there's something about names that goes deeper than sound.</p>
<p>The Aboriginals in Australia—and Claire can correct me if I'm butchering this—believe that naming something gives it existence.  The land was sung into being.  Songlines crisscross the continent, and the act of naming a place, singing its name, is what makes it real.  The map and the song are the same thing.  If you stop singing, the place doesn't stop existing, but your relationship to it does.</p>
<p>I don't know if that's precisely right.  I read about it in a Bill Bryson book, which means it's probably eighty percent accurate and twenty percent Bill Bryson being charming about things he half-understands.  But the idea stuck with me.</p>
<p>We name things to claim them.  To make them ours.  To make them real.</p>
<p>When I was a kid, my brothers and I named everything.  The tree in the backyard was Gerald.  Don't ask me why.  Gerald just looked like a Gerald.  There was a rock near the mailbox called The Senator because it was large and did nothing.  We had a recurring imaginary villain named Dr. Franks who lived in the storm drain.  Dr. Franks had no backstory, no motivation, no character arc.  He was just a name we yelled when we needed a bad guy.  "Dr. Franks is coming!"  That was enough.  The name made him real enough to run from.</p>
<p>I still do this.  I name my moods.  I name phases of my life.  The Summer of Bad Decisions.  The Semester I Couldn't Sleep.  The Week I Only Ate Cereal.  Naming them makes them finite.  A thing with a name has edges.  It starts and it stops.  It's not a shapeless cloud of experience drifting through your life without structure.  It's a chapter.  Chapters end.</p>
<p>Claire has a lot of names.  There's Claire, obviously.  But then there's the versions.  There's the Claire her parents see, the Claire her friends see, the Claire Australia made, the Claire that emerges specifically when she's annoyed with me—that one has a very distinct energy, very focused, very efficient in her disappointment.  </p>
<p>I don't think I've met all of her yet.  I think there are versions of Claire that haven't been named because the situations that produce them haven't happened.  We haven't had kids yet.  We haven't bought a house yet.  We haven't been old together yet.  There are Claires waiting to exist, and I want to be there when they show up.  I want to see what they're called.</p>
<p>Zachary David Rowe Murphy.  Four names, one person.  Or maybe four names, several people, stacked in a trench coat pretending to be one guy.  The kid who wrote that thirteen-page book in Oklahoma.  The teenager who thought he was invincible.  The man sitting in a law school library at midnight, writing a book for a woman who just told him she doesn't like reading.</p>
<p>All named Zach.  All me.  Mostly.</p>

<h2>Silence</h2>
<p>I don't think people appreciate silence anymore.  And I mean real silence—not the "I have my AirPods in but nothing's playing" kind.  Not the silence of a library where you can hear seventeen people breathing and someone three tables over is eating chips with the audacity of a man who has never been told no.  I mean the kind of silence where your ears ring because they've forgotten what to do with themselves.</p>
<p>I experienced it once in the desert outside Boulder City.  I was probably sixteen.  I drove out to the edge of town, past where the houses stop and the dirt starts, parked the car, got out, and just stood there.  No wind that day.  No planes overhead.  No highway noise.  Nothing.</p>
<p>And for about thirty seconds, I heard absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>Your brain does a thing where it tries to fill the gap.  Like it can't accept that the input channel is empty, so it manufactures something.  That ringing—it's not actually a sound.  It's your auditory system going, "Hello?  Hello?  Is this thing on?"  Your own biology can't handle the absence of noise.</p>
<p>I think about this a lot.  Not the science of it—I'm not qualified for that conversation and I'm not going to pretend I am.  I think about what it means that silence is so foreign to us that our bodies treat it as a malfunction.</p>
<p>We are a profoundly loud species.  We built cities, which are just noise factories with apartments attached.  We invented car horns, leaf blowers, fireworks.  We put speakers in grocery stores so you can listen to a worse version of a song you already didn't like while you decide between two percent and whole milk.  We engineered an entire world where silence is almost impossible to find, and then we complain about being overstimulated.  We did this to ourselves.</p>
<p>Claire is quiet in a way that I don't encounter often.  Not shy.  Not reserved.  Quiet.  There's a difference.  Shy people want to talk but can't.  Reserved people can talk but choose not to.  Claire exists in a third category where she's comfortable with the absence of conversation in a way that used to unnerve me.</p>
<p>I grew up in a family of four boys.  Silence didn't exist.  Silence was a tactical error—if you weren't talking, someone else was talking, and if someone else was talking, the narrative was being shaped without your input.  Silence was ceding territory.  You talked because talking was how you survived.</p>
<p>I brought this into every relationship, every friendship, every interaction I've ever had.  Fill the space.  Be funny.  Be loud.  Be present in the most audible way possible.  If there's a gap in conversation, it's my job to plug it.  If nobody's laughing, something has gone wrong.</p>
<p>Claire broke this.  Not intentionally.  She didn't sit me down and say, "Zach, you talk too much, and your need to fill every moment of silence is a defense mechanism rooted in childhood dynamics."  She just... didn't fill the gaps.  And at first, I panicked.  Is she bored?  Is she mad?  Did I say something wrong?  Is this the part where she realizes she could do better?  My brain ran through the diagnostic checklist at full speed.</p>
<p>But she was just sitting there.  Existing.  Comfortably.  Not needing the space to be filled.</p>
<p>It took me an embarrassingly long time to learn how to do that.  To just sit with someone and not perform.  To let a silence be a silence and not a crisis.  To accept that two people can be in the same room, not talking, and that's not a failure of the relationship—it's evidence of it.</p>
<p>The best relationships, I think, are the ones where silence isn't loaded.  Where it doesn't mean anger or boredom or distance.  Where it just means: I'm here.  You're here.  That's enough.</p>
<p>I'm not there yet, fully.  I still catch myself reaching for the joke, the observation, the unnecessary commentary.  Old habits.  The four-boy household left deep grooves.  But I'm better than I was.  And the fact that I can sit on the phone with Claire for twenty minutes, neither of us saying anything, and not feel like I'm drowning—that's growth.  That's the kind of growth that doesn't show up on a transcript.</p>
<p>It's the silence between the words.  </p>
<p>In music, rests are notated just as carefully as notes.  A rest isn't the absence of music.  It's part of the music.  The silence is composed.  It's intentional.  It's doing something.  Take the rests out of a piece of music and you get noise—an unbroken wall of sound that your brain can't parse.  The rests give the notes meaning.  The silence gives the sound shape.</p>
<p>I think conversations work the same way.  The pauses are where the understanding happens.  The moments where nobody is talking are the moments where what was just said actually lands.  If you fill every gap, nothing lands.  You're just producing noise.</p>
<p>I used to produce a lot of noise.</p>
<p>I still do, sometimes.  I'm doing it right now, actually—writing thousands of words about the value of silence.  The irony is not lost on me.  I am aware that I am loudly advocating for quiet.  I contain contradictions.  We've been over this.</p>
<p>But I'm learning.  Slowly.  In the silences between these words, in the spaces I'm leaving on the page, in the gaps between what I say and what I mean—something is happening.  Something that doesn't need to be named, doesn't need to be analyzed, doesn't need to be turned into a bit.</p>
<p>It just needs to exist.</p>
<p>Quietly.</p>

<h2>Grocery</h2>
<p>You can learn everything you need to know about a person by watching them in a grocery store.  I'm serious.  Forget personality tests.  Forget astrology.  Forget whatever Myers-Briggs letter combination you think justifies your behavior.  Just go to a Kroger and observe.</p>
<p>There are cart people and basket people.  This is the first and most important division in human temperament.  Cart people are planners.  They have a list.  They have a route.  They know which aisle has the canned tomatoes and they will not be distracted by the seasonal display of pumpkin-flavored things near the entrance, even though those displays are specifically engineered to distract you, which frankly should be illegal.  Cart people are buying for the week.  Cart people have their lives together, or at least they want you to believe they do.</p>
<p>Basket people are improvisers.  They came in for one thing—maybe two.  They will leave with seven.  The basket starts light and gets progressively heavier until they're carrying it with both hands, red-faced, doing a kind of lateral shuffle toward checkout because they refuse to admit that they should have gotten a cart.  The basket person would rather suffer physical discomfort than walk back to the front of the store and admit they underestimated their own appetite.  This is a personality disorder.  I am a basket person.</p>
<p>Then there are the people who don't get a cart or a basket.  They just walk in and cradle things in their arms like they're rescuing produce from a burning building.  A bag of chips wedged under the chin.  A carton of eggs balanced on top of a six-pack.  Two bananas clutched in a hand that's also holding a phone.  These people are agents of chaos.  They are one sneeze away from a complete structural failure.  I respect them.</p>
<p>The checkout line is where character is truly revealed.  Self-checkout is for people who don't want to interact with humans.  I'm not judging—I'm one of them.  But we should be honest about what we're choosing.  We are choosing to do the labor of scanning and bagging our own groceries in exchange for not having to make thirty seconds of small talk with a nineteen-year-old named Kyle.  That's the trade.  And we're taking it every time.</p>
<p>The express lane—"15 Items or Less"—is a social contract, and there are people who violate it.  You know who you are.  You rolled up with twenty-two items thinking, what are they going to do, count?  Yes.  I'm counting.  I'm standing behind you counting every single item you put on that belt and I'm furious.  Not visibly furious.  I'm from the South.  We do our fury internally while smiling.  But make no mistake, justice is being tabulated.</p>
<p>I once watched a woman in front of me at a Piggly Wiggly unload what I can only describe as a preparedness haul.  Canned goods.  Bulk rice.  Water jugs.  Either she was feeding a family of twelve or she had information about an incoming event that the rest of us did not.  She was in the express lane.  Fifteen items or less.  She had—and I counted—thirty-eight items.  The cashier didn't say a word.  Nobody said a word.  We all just stood there, witnesses to a crime with no prosecutor.</p>
<p>That's society, by the way.  We make rules.  Nobody enforces them.  We all quietly agree to pretend the violation didn't happen.  The social contract isn't a contract at all—it's a suggestion.</p>
<p>Claire shops differently than I do.  She reads labels.  She reads the back of the box.  She picks things up, considers them, puts them back, picks them up again.  It's like watching someone negotiate a hostage situation with a jar of pasta sauce.  I find it endearing.  I also find it slow.  I am in and out.  I am a surgical strike.  I know what I want, I know where it is, and I am leaving.</p>
<p>But I've noticed something.  When Claire shops, she comes home with things that actually make sense together.  Like, she buys ingredients.  For meals.  That she will cook.  The items in her cart have a relationship to one another.  They are parts of a whole.</p>
<p>When I shop, I come home with a bag of shredded cheese, a box of Wheat Thins, two limes, and a frozen pizza.  These items do not know each other.  They have nothing in common.  They were selected independently based on the criteria of "that looks good right now" with zero regard for any future version of myself who might want a coherent meal.</p>
<p>I am a basket person buying unrelated items in the self-checkout lane.  Claire is a cart person buying ingredients in the regular lane.  And somehow we work.  Somehow these two approaches to the same mundane task—getting food so you don't die—coexist.  She plans.  I react.  She reads the label.  I check if it's on sale.  She builds a meal.  I assemble a snack plate and call it dinner.</p>
<p>I used to think compatibility was about the big things.  Shared values.  Shared goals.  Where you want to live.  How many kids you want.  And those things matter—obviously.  But I think the real compatibility test is the grocery store.  Can you be in a Kroger together for forty-five minutes and still like each other when you leave?  Can you survive the produce section, where one of you wants organic and the other wants cheap?  Can you merge your items onto the same belt without it feeling like a hostage negotiation?</p>
<p>If you can grocery shop together, you can do anything together.</p>
<p>We haven't done it yet, actually.  Claire and I have never had a normal grocery run.  Different countries, different schedules, different continents.  But I think about it.  I think about the mundane future—the boring, beautiful, ordinary stuff that most people take for granted.  The grocery store on a Sunday morning.  The argument about whether we need more olive oil (we always need more olive oil).  The moment in the cereal aisle where she reaches for something healthy and I reach for something that is essentially candy in a box and we both look at each other and know exactly who we married.</p>
<p>I want that.  I want the grocery store.  I want the cart or the basket or the chaos arms.  I want the express lane argument and the self-checkout beep and the "do we need milk?" text that I will receive while already in the car and already a mile from the store.</p>
<p>I want the whole mundane, beautiful thing.</p>

<h2>Driving</h2>
<p>I have driven across this country more times than most people have left their zip code, and I will defend until my last breath that the American road trip is the single greatest experience available to a person with a car, a debit card, and questionable judgment.</p>
<p>You cannot fly over this country and understand it.  You cannot look at a map—we've already established that maps lie—and grasp what's between the coasts.  You have to drive it.  You have to sit in a car for fourteen hours and watch the landscape change so slowly that you almost don't notice it happening.  The Midwest doesn't announce itself.  It doesn't have a welcome sign that says "Welcome to Flat."  It just gradually becomes flat, and at some point you look around and realize you can see the curvature of the earth and there's a grain elevator on the horizon that you've been staring at for forty-five minutes because it's the only vertical thing in your field of vision.</p>
<p>My family moved constantly.  Oklahoma.  Nevada.  Virginia.  Back.  And we drove every time.  Not always—sometimes we flew.  But the moves I remember, the ones that stuck, were the ones where we loaded up the car and just went.</p>
<p>There's a stretch of I-40 between Amarillo and Albuquerque that is the most desolate road in the country.  I'll argue this with anyone.  There is nothing.  For miles and miles and miles, there is nothing.  The occasional exit leads to a town that Google Maps assures you exists but that shows no visible signs of life from the highway.  You start to wonder if you've driven off the edge of civilization.  You start to wonder if this is what the moon looks like.  You start to wonder if the gas station you passed forty minutes ago was your last chance and you just blew it.</p>
<p>And then—right when you've accepted your fate, right when you've made peace with dying in the New Mexico desert and having your remains discovered by a confused coyote—you see a sign for a Love's Travel Stop.  And suddenly everything is fine.  Hot dogs on rollers.  Fountain drinks the size of a small child.  A bathroom that could be cleaner but you're in no position to negotiate.  Civilization.</p>
<p>The truck stop is the American oasis.  I don't care what anyone says.  A Love's, a Pilot, a Flying J—these are cathedrals.  They are monuments to the idea that no matter how far into the void you've driven, someone out there is selling beef jerky and diesel fuel and those weird sunglasses that spin on a rack.</p>
<p>My dad drove most of the time.  He'd set the cruise control and just exist.  Didn't talk much.  Didn't need the radio, though my mom would put it on.  He'd drink coffee from a thermos—always a thermos, never a gas station cup—and scan the highway with the focus of a man who took the responsibility of not killing his family very seriously.  Which, looking back, was the right approach.</p>
<p>My brothers and I were in the back doing what brothers do in a car, which is a combination of sleeping, fighting, and asking "are we there yet?" with a frequency that should constitute a form of torture.  We had a GameBoy.  One GameBoy.  For four boys.  If you don't think that's a Lord of the Flies situation, you've never shared a GameBoy with three siblings on a twelve-hour drive.</p>
<p>But the moments I remember aren't the fights.  They're the weird in-between ones.  The sunrise over the Texas panhandle that turned the sky a color I've never been able to describe—not orange, not pink, something that doesn't have a name.  Stopping at a rest area in Arkansas where there was a dog, just a dog, sitting by the vending machines like he worked there.  My mom pointing at something out the window—a barn, a river, a cloud shaped like something—and all of us looking, actually looking, for once.</p>
<p>I want to drive across this country with Claire.  I've thought about it enough that I have a rough route.  We'd start somewhere in the Carolinas—probably Aiken, because that's home now—and go west.  Through Tennessee.  Through Memphis, where I'd make her eat barbecue until she couldn't move.  Through Arkansas, where there's nothing but I'd make up a reason to stop.  Through Oklahoma, where I'd show her where I lived, though there's nothing to see.  Through the Texas panhandle, where we'd see that sunrise.  Through New Mexico, through that dead stretch of I-40, through the desert that looks like the moon.  Into Arizona.  Into Nevada.  Into Boulder City, where I'd show her everything.</p>
<p>And she'd complain.  She'd complain about the heat and the driving and the truck stop food and the fact that I insist on listening to the same playlist for eight hundred miles.  And I'd love every second of it.  Because complaining on a road trip is participation.  It means you're there.  It means you're present.  The person who doesn't complain on a road trip isn't engaged—they're enduring.  Give me the complaints.  Give me the "can we please stop, my legs are going numb."  Give me the "why are we taking this exit, there's nothing here."  Give me the "Zach, if you play that song one more time, I will open this door at seventy miles per hour."</p>
<p>That's the trip.  That's the whole thing.  Two people in a car, disagreeing about exits and playlists and when to stop for food, watching the country change shape around them, slowly becoming a version of themselves that only exists on the road.</p>
<p>The road trip version of you is different.  You're more honest at hour eight.  You're funnier at hour twelve.  You're a philosopher at hour fifteen, saying things that sound profound in the car and absolutely insane when you repeat them at a dinner party.  "I realized on I-40 that time is a flat circle and gas station coffee is the only constant."  Sure, Zach.  Sure.</p>
<p>I don't know when we'll do it.  Logistics.  Visas.  Life.  But it's on the list.  And when it happens, I'm driving.  That's non-negotiable.  She can control the music.  She can control the thermostat—which is a major concession, for the record.  She can decide when we stop, where we eat, which motel we stay at.  But I'm driving.  Because my dad drove, and his dad drove, and there is something deeply, irrationally important to me about being the one behind the wheel when the woman I love is in the passenger seat and the road ahead doesn't end.</p>

<h2>Brothers</h2>
<p>Having three brothers is not a personality trait, but it is a pre-existing condition.</p>
<p>People without brothers don't understand.  And I don't mean that in a gatekeeping way—I mean it literally.  The experience cannot be explained to someone who didn't live it.  It's like trying to explain war to someone who's only seen movies about it.  The movies get some things right.  The chaos.  The noise.  The vague sense that at any moment, everything could go sideways for no reason.  But they miss the specific, granular absurdity of it.  The randomness.  The complete absence of logic governing who gets hit next.</p>
<p>Four boys.  My parents had four boys.  I need you to sit with that for a moment.  Four.  My mother—a woman of grace and patience and a faith in God that has been tested more rigorously than any clinical trial—looked at one boy, then two boys, then three boys, and said, "Let's do it again."  This is either the bravest decision in the history of parenting or clinical insanity.  I have never asked her which.  I'm afraid of the answer.</p>
<p>The hierarchy is everything.  I'm the oldest.  This means I was the test subject.  Every rule my parents ever made, they made because I did something first.  "Don't climb on the roof."  Why does that rule exist?  Because Zach climbed on the roof.  "Don't put things in the microwave that aren't food."  Because Zach put something in the microwave that wasn't food.  I was the legislative history of our household.  Every regulation had a corresponding Zach Incident.</p>
<p>Mack, Cal, Jack.  In that order.  And each one entered the family like a new character being introduced in the second act of a show that was already barely holding together.  Mack showed up and suddenly I wasn't the baby anymore—which was the first real loss of my life and I've never fully processed it.  Cal arrived and we officially outnumbered our parents, which shifted the balance of power in ways they didn't anticipate.  Jack came last and by that point, the household was essentially a failed state with snacks.</p>
<p>We fought about everything.  Not in a concerning way—in the way that brothers fight, which is constantly, physically, and with a complete lack of lasting consequence.  You could be wrestling your brother on the living room floor at 3 p.m. and sitting next to him eating dinner at 6 p.m. like nothing happened.  No grudges.  No therapy.  No processing.  Just: that happened, and now this is happening, and those two things don't need to be connected.</p>
<p>I think this is genuinely confusing to people who didn't grow up this way.  Claire will ask, "Are you and your brother okay?  You guys seemed tense."  Tense?  We weren't tense.  We were communicating.  That was a normal interaction.  You should see us when we're actually upset—it's quieter.  The silence is the warning sign.  When brothers go quiet, that's when you should worry.</p>
<p>There's a shorthand that develops.  A language made of references nobody else understands.  Inside jokes from 2006 that still get deployed at the dinner table in 2026.  A single word—sometimes not even a word, just a sound—that makes all four of us laugh and makes everyone else in the room feel like they're witnessing a cult ritual.  </p>
<p>I can't explain these to Claire.  I've tried.  "You had to be there" is the refuge of every person whose funniest memories are untranslatable.  And the best brother memories are profoundly untranslatable.  They rely on a shared context that was built over decades in specific rooms in specific houses in specific cities that don't exist anymore.  Not literally—the houses are still there.  But the version of those houses where four boys lived, where the walls absorbed that specific frequency of noise, where the backyard meant what it meant—that's gone.  It exists only in the four of us.</p>
<p>Mack's in Boulder City now.  Cal and Jack are in Aiken with my parents.  I'm in Wisconsin.  We're scattered.  This is what happens—you grow up piled on top of each other, sharing rooms, sharing a GameBoy, sharing the same air, and then one day you're in four different places and the group chat is the only room you're all in at the same time.</p>
<p>But here's the thing.  And I think this is the thing I want Claire to understand, the thing that matters more than any specific story or joke or reference.  When I walk into a room where all three of my brothers are, something happens that doesn't happen anywhere else.  Some version of me that only exists in their presence comes online.  Not the law student.  Not the boyfriend.  Not the adult.  Just the oldest of four.  The original.  The test subject.</p>
<p>And I am funnier in that room than I will ever be in any other room.  That is a statistical fact.  The audience matters, and there is no better audience than people who have known you since before you were a person.  They remember the raw material.  They know what you were before you decided what to be.  And they will absolutely never let you forget it.</p>
<p>I want Claire in that room eventually.  Not as a guest.  As a permanent addition.  And she should know going in that the room is loud, the jokes don't make sense, someone's probably going to get hit, and nobody will explain why we're laughing.</p>
<p>But she'll be there.  And eventually, years from now, she'll be in on the joke.  She'll deploy the single word that makes everyone laugh.  She'll have her own version of "you had to be there."</p>
<p>And my mom will look at my dad and think: five.  We have five now.</p>
<p>God help us all.</p>

<h2>Time</h2>
<p>Sixteen hours.</p>
<p>That's the time difference between us at its worst.  Or its best, depending on how you frame it.  Claire is either sixteen hours ahead of me or eight hours behind me.  Either she's living in my future or I'm living in her past.  We've never been able to figure out which one is the more romantic way to describe it, which probably tells you everything you need to know about long-distance relationships: even the poetry is logistically complicated.</p>
<p>When I wake up, she's going to bed.  When I'm eating lunch, she's asleep.  When I'm in Evidence class learning about hearsay exceptions, she's waking up and I'm already a full day ahead of her in emotional development.  I've had an entire day's worth of feelings that she hasn't gotten to yet.  I'm out here evolving as a person and she's still on yesterday.</p>
<p>I'm being dramatic.  But only slightly.</p>
<p>Here's what nobody tells you about long distance.  They tell you it's hard—that's the thing everyone leads with, like they're warning you about a pothole on the highway.  "Long distance is hard."  Thank you.  Groundbreaking insight.  Is water also wet?  But what they don't tell you is that it's weird.  Not hard-weird.  Structurally weird.  The mechanics of loving someone in a different time zone create situations that are so absurd they loop back around to being kind of beautiful.</p>
<p>I have celebrated Claire's birthday before she did.  I've said "happy birthday" and she's said "it's not my birthday yet."  I've wished her happy New Year while she was still in last year.  I have literally been in her future.  I possessed information about what her birthday felt like before she experienced it.  I was a time traveler.  A really lame one, but still.</p>
<p>FaceTime has become the architecture of our relationship.  Not a supplement to it—the architecture.  Most couples have a living room, a kitchen, a bed.  We have a screen.  A six-inch rectangle that contains the entirety of our shared physical space.  Every conversation, every argument, every "how was your day," every "I miss you"—all filtered through a screen that sometimes freezes at the worst possible moment.</p>
<p>You haven't lived until you've tried to have a serious emotional conversation and the other person's face freezes mid-word and they look like they're having a stroke.  You wait.  You say "hello?"  You say "can you hear me?"  And then suddenly it unfreezes and they've moved on to a completely different topic and you're emotionally stranded on the thing they said forty-five seconds ago that you never got to respond to.  Technology has given us the miracle of video calling across the globe and also the indignity of buffering during "I love you."</p>
<p>But here's what I've learned.  And it took me a long time to learn it, and I'm probably still learning it.  The distance isn't the hard part.  The distance is the obvious part—the part everyone sees, the part everyone asks about, the part that makes people tilt their head sympathetically and say, "Wow, I could never."  Cool.  Thanks for your support.</p>
<p>The hard part is the time.</p>
<p>Not time zones.  Time itself.  The fact that we are spending a finite amount of it apart.  That there are days—hundreds of them—where the person I want to be with is living a life I'm not in.  She's having mornings I don't see.  She's eating dinners I don't cook.  She's falling asleep in a room I've never been in, in a city I barely know, on a continent I've visited once.</p>
<p>And those days don't come back.  That's the math that keeps me up.  Not "we're far apart"—that's geography, and geography is solvable.  But "we're spending this time apart, and this time is the time we have, and we don't get more of it."  That's the part that sits in your chest at 2 a.m. when you're doing the mental arithmetic of visas and flights and semesters and summers and trying to figure out when the numbers start working in your favor.</p>
<p>But then.</p>
<p>But then she answers the phone.  And she's just woken up and her hair is a disaster and she's squinting at the screen because the brightness is too high and she says something—usually something mundane, something about what she dreamed or what she's going to eat or how some bird outside her window won't shut up—and the math stops.  The arithmetic dissolves.  The spreadsheet of days and hours and time zones collapses into a single point: she's here.  On the screen.  Talking to me.</p>
<p>And I know it's not the same as being there.  I know a screen isn't a room.  I know FaceTime isn't a substitute for the real thing—for sitting next to someone, for reaching over, for the thousand tiny physical facts of sharing a space.</p>
<p>But it's not nothing.  It's a six-inch rectangle that contains the person I love, buffering and all.  And until the distance closes, until the time zones collapse, until we're in the same room arguing about the thermostat and fighting over the blanket and doing all the mundane, boring, beautiful things that people who live together take for granted—until then, the rectangle is enough.</p>
<p>It has to be.</p>
<p>And honestly?  Some days it is.  Some days she laughs at something I said and the lag means I hear it a half-second late and it arrives like a gift that got delayed in shipping.  And I think: okay.  Sixteen hours.  Eight hours.  Whatever the math is.  We're in the same moment right now.  The same second.  Across all that distance, all those time zones, all that ocean—we're laughing at the same thing at the same time.</p>
<p>That's not nothing.  That's everything.</p>
